          <h2>How diverse is the "Big Three" film festivals?</h2>

        <div class="intro-wrapper">
          <p>The issue of diversity in the film industry has always been a hot but unarguable topic. And because of the nature of storytelling and entertainment for the mass audience of films, this lack of diversity ultimately leads to the question of <b>“who gets to tell the stories”</b> and <b>“whose stories get to be heard”</b>, which could consolidate inequalities to some extent.
          </p>
          <p>As a vital assessment of quality and success in filmmaking, <b>film festivals</b> seem to be a practical point to look at the diversity of this industry. However, interestingly, many debates on this issue focus on <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/oscars-2022-diversity-v-data-what-analysis-of-93-years-of-winners-tells-us-about-the-academy-awards-11635455"><b>the Oscar</b></a>, an award mainly focuses on the American film industry (starting to gear towards international only in recent years). It’s reasonable since the USA is a country with diverse populations. Still, it also seems unfair to criticize so much on a film festival that is mainly limited to one country. I believe that <a href="https://timesupfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/aii-inclusion-film-festivals-20200127.pdf"><b>the film festivals</b></a> that aim to award excellent films internationally should also be brought to the center of debates and analyses on diversity and inclusion since they also share the same problem.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, I wonder: <span style="color: #e7be3e"><b>Are these international film festivals diverse enough?</b></span> If not, <span style="color: #e7be3e"><b>what might be the reason for their lack of diversity?</b></span> To answer these questions, this data story will try to visualize the troubling status-quo of the diversity in these film festivals and explore a possible answer to why this happens.</p>

            <h1>Diversity of the directors</h1>
          </div>
          <div class="selection-intro-wrapper">
            <p>This data story will focus on the “Big Three”, namely, the <span style="color: #e7be3e">Venice , Cannes, and Berlin International Festival</span> because these are the most prestigious film festivals globally. I believe their diversity could be a persuasive evidence of the status quo in this industry worldwide. And simultaneously, as these three film festivals also concentrate on different perspectives of the film (artistic and commercial achievements for Cannes, political and social value for Berlin, and a combination of all in Venice), I think it’ll be effective to showcase the inclusiveness in movies of different topics. </p>
            <p>And because of the storytelling nature of film, the following part wil focus on <span style="color: #e7be3e">the diversity of the directors</span>, since they are the one whom the biggest award of the film festivals goes to and one of the most important person of filmmaking that they pretty much decides what stories will be told in the film. This visualization would also only focus on <span style="color: #e7be3e">the nominated directors of the main competition</span> of each festival (the "Golden Palm" for Cannes, the "Golden Bear" for Berlin, and the "Golden Lion" in Venice), since they are the most representative and important awards in the festivals.</p>

        <p>Having introduced the diversity of the "Big Three" film festivals using the data of the last decade, hopefully you have had a glimpe of the concerning diversity of these 3 biggest film festivals in the world. Based on the diversity of gender and geographical region of the nominated directors and juries, we can see that some parts of the world and female directors are still underrepresented in the film industry. As we're living in this world full of intertainments, it's highly crucial to have the underrepresented to speak out so that they aren't swallowed by the massive flow of information. </p>
