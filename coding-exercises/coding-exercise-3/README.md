# Coding Exercise 3
Data about "Questions in my everyday life", with 4 features:
1. This question is triggered by...?
2. This question is about...?
3. The time & date I came up with the question
4. The specific question

I struggled with trying to scale the time and date
I wanted to draw a x and y axis but failed, so I just simplified it as linear scale

Also, I wanted the long sentence to wrap when it reaches certain width, so that the sentences won't overlap each other. However, I don't know how to do that...
