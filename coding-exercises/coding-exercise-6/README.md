Exercise:
This coding exercise practiced the entering/updating/exiting function of d3. The surprise button would sort the bars and assign them with new colors that is in gradation.

Questions:
1. I don't really understand how this works:  
xAxis.tickFormat(d=>{return data.filter(dd=>dd.key==d)[0].name;});
2. Why when I updated the bars and console log "elementsForPage", I got 11 _enter elements, 10_exit, and 11 _groups?
