# Reading Response 3: Predictive Policing

## Predictive Contemporary Systems/Applications
1. Data-driven software systems used to process HR applications:  
In an example brought up in Reading 1, "I Data You, You Data Me", a large corporation uses word2vec inside a piece of software to process HR applications and hire employees by comparing the distance between the keywords in the candidates' resume and the expected quality. In this way, the corporation predicted the candidates' future performance in work based on the data in word2vec and then hire their desired candidates.
2. Caesars Entertainment uses data to determine staffing needs:  
| Since customer amount fluctuate a lot from time to time in the entertainment and hospital industries, companies like Caesars Entertainment analyzed data and developed a multiple regression model to decide on the staffing numbers based on the predicted cutomers to avoid overstaffing.
3. The customer relationship management process predicts consumers' behavior:  
| The customer relationship management process sketches out the consumers' characteristics based on data from different channels such as company's website, telephone, and social media. Then the businesses design business campaignes and strategies based on the consumers' preference to keep their past and present costomers and attract potential customers.

## Prediction
Having read and listened to the above sources, I understood that prediction, especially in the context of data, is about speculating the future based on the extensive collection of and analysis of past and present information/data on a particular issue. I think prediction has both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it could help us predict the future and provide guidelines for acting on a particular issue. On the other hand, the prediction is never accurate, nor could it reflect the actual future. There will always be bias and details left out.
### Minority Report
The novella talked about how head police commissioner Anderton struggled between keeping the precrime system and his own fate. The final prediction is made by comparing the three different predictions made by the three precogs and getting the "majority report," which result is predicted by at least two of the precogs. The final prediction here did succeed in preventing nearly all the crimes. However, it is the collective average, and there is still a possibility that what will actually happen is the "minority report", and innocent people are prisoned.
### What Statistics Can and Can't Tell Us About Ourselves
Here in this article, prediction is proposed as an alarm of the possibility that something terrible might happen or might be happening if its amount exceeds a certain threshold. The author mentioned the examples of the effectiveness of aspirin and the murder case of Dr.Shipman to indicate that predictions can tell that something is likely to happen, and having the assumed likelihood will benefit those potential victims. However, the author also proposed the problem of where the threshold should be set so that the prediction would not harm the innocent but also benefit the victims.
### The Crime Machine
The podcast talked about the system that the New York police use to minimize the crime rate. However, as issued in the podcast, the system later caused the police to arrest innocent people and downplay serious crimes. Thus, the "crime machine" here did predict the crimes and decreased the crime rate at first, but later became a biased machine that brought misery to people because of the biased and manipulated data that are fed into the system.
Thus, I think how much do we rely on the predictions and how reflective we are when we adapt the predictions is vital in analyzing the predictions.
