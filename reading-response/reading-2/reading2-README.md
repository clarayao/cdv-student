[This] (https://pudding.cool/2018/08/pockets/) data visualization "Pockets" by Jan Diehm & Amber Thomas illustrated the ongoing issue of how small pockets of women's clothes are when comparing to men's. In this data visualization, they collected the size of the pockets of pants in 20 of the US' most popular blue jeans brands, and visualized them by drawing the pockets of both women and men next to each other.

To further make the visualization more intuitively, they also draw different sizes of phones, hands, wallets, etc. when put into women/men's pockets.

Simultaneously, a webpage that looks like a shopping website is shown, and those pockets that can't fit the items listed have faded color that looks as if they were "sold out".

I think this data visualization successfully meets the reading's idea that "data can be used to elevate emotion and embodiment". By placing men and women's pockets that are surprisingly different in size next to each other, a comparison between the two is shown. Simultaneously, by visualizing how well certain commonly-used items could fit into the pockets and especially by displaying how well of the men's jeans can fit the items while women's can't, a strong emotion about the ridiculousness of this common phenomenon is brought front.

At the same time, this visualization is also successful in incorporating visual minimalism and emotion, just like Periscopic's example in the reading. Although the visualization didn't use the conventional chart, it still illustrated the difference in the size of men and women's pockets by graphing only the outline of the pockets. The strong emotion is clearly delivered by using the minimalistic graph and number.
